<!--
? Do you feel this version is easier to read than the version you made in the previous week?
* Yes, this version is easier to read. The code looks more simple and clear.

? Is this version more efficient or not or is there no difference?
* There is no big difference in performance. This version is just easier to understand.

? Async/await makes the code wait until the Promise is resolved. Does this then also block any other functions from running? Why or why not?
* No, async/await does not block other functions. The code waits for the result, but other things can still happen in the background.
